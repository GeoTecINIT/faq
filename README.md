[Add a record on Zenodo to the UJI community](#Zenodo-UJI-comunity)


## Zenodo - UJI community


[Universitat Jaume I Research Data](https://zenodo.org/communities/universitatjaumei/) community on Zenodo lists collections of datasets and publications from Universitat Jaume I researchers.


To add an existing record published by GEOTEC researchers on Zenodo to this community:

- `Edit` the record
- Add **Universitat Jaume I Research Data** community under the "Communities" section, 
- `Save`, and finally `publish`.

The community curator (university library) will then be notified to either accept or reject the new record.
